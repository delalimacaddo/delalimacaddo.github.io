                </p>
                <p class="intro-graph">
                    Picture this: You're 25, scrolling Instagram. You see someone who feels familiar — whose roots, identity, or culture mirror your own. They're wearing a familiar outfit (kente cloth) at graduation. They're from Ondo State, Nigeria — maybe even the same place as your cousin. They've started a business that's thriving and solving real problems. They embody your idea of a successful career.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-graph">
                    The caption says: "Discover how the university helped make it happen."
                </p>
                <p class="intro-graph">
                    That post isn't random. It's part of a larger pattern in how postgraduate opportunity is represented.
                </p>
                <div class="stat-callout">
                    Between January and September 2024, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada processed nearly <strong>122,000 study permit applications</strong> from Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, and Nigeria. Each one represents a dream and a vision of the future.
                </div>
                <p class="intro-graph">
                    But here's what we don't usually ask: <em>How do universities shape that vision?</em> What makes a 25-year-old in West Africa believe that studying in Canada is not just possible, but meant for them and tied to their career ambitions?
                </p>
                <p class="intro-graph">
                    I spent months analyzing the Instagram feeds, website pages, LinkedIn posts, and YouTube videos of two major Canadian universities. I examined what they post, who they feature, and how they tell stories about postgraduate opportunity.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-graph">
                    What I found wasn't random. It was a system. A three-layer narrative structure that appears again and again, post after post, story after story.
                </p>
                <div class="stat-highlight">
                    <strong>Layer 1:</strong> They show you someone who shares similar identities to yours.<br>
                    <strong>Layer 2:</strong> They show you what that person achieved.<br>
                    <strong>Layer 3:</strong> They tell you where it happened.
                </div>
                <p class="intro-graph">
                    This is how opportunity is represented. Not through facts or statistics or program descriptions. Through <strong>Identity. Achievement. Affiliation.</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="intro-graph">
                    And it works because it taps into something deeper than logic. It shapes <em>imagination</em> itself — what you believe is possible, who you see yourself becoming, and where you think you belong.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-graph">
                    Keep scrolling. Pay special attention to the visuals along the way. It will show you exactly how this system works. <span class="scroll-arrow" aria-hidden="true">&#8595;</span>

                    What you just scrolled through tells you something. Post after post, African students and alumni are featured telling their stories in their own voices — each one anchored by names, home cities, and cultural markers.

                    This is not incidental. It is a representational choice.

                <p class="intro-graph">
                    By highlighting these elements, universities make African identities visible within the Canadian campus context. The content repeatedly links specific cities, cultures, and national identities to the institution itself. Geographic distance is not ignored. It is addressed visually.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-graph">
                    Familiarity plays a role here — language that resonates, faces that reflect shared backgrounds, stories told in recognizable ways. What might feel abstract or distant begins to feel tangible. The space becomes imaginable. Attainable.

                    This isn't random. This is strategy. This is how you make distant institutions feel accessible. How you turn application numbers into enrollment numbers.

                    But here's what we need to talk about.

                <p class="intro-graph">
                    These stories aren't lies. Olugbenga is real. Faith is real. Their achievements are real.

                <p class="intro-graph">
                    But representation is selective. For every success story you see, there are stories you don't. The student who couldn't afford to stay. The visa that got denied. The graduate who moved back home because the job market didn't work out.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-graph">
                    Instagram algorithms reward engagement. University branding prioritizes impact. So what gets amplified? The wins. The highlights. The proof that the system works.

                <p class="intro-graph">
                    What stays quiet? Everything else.

                    <strong>If you're a prospective student:</strong> These stories are powerful. Let them inspire you. But ask questions too. What's the full picture? What happens when things don't go according to plan?<br><br>
                    <strong>If you're a university:</strong> You're not just marketing programs. You're shaping futures. The stories you choose to tell—and the ones you don't—matter more than you think.

                    Here's what I keep thinking about.

                <p class="intro-graph">
                    Every year, 122,000 people from West Africa apply to study in Canada. Behind each application is a late-night research session. A family conversation. A vision of the future.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-graph">
                    And that vision? It's shaped by posts like these. By the stories universities choose to tell. By who gets to be visible and who stays in the background.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-graph centered-italic">
                    Recognition. Achievement. Direction.

                <p class="intro-graph">
                    That's the formula. That's how opportunity gets sold.

                <p class="pullquote centered">
                    What you see shapes what you believe is possible. And that shaping of imagination? That might be the most powerful form of representation there is.
